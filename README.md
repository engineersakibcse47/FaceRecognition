## Genarel Overview
This git repository conatin a Face Recognition Attendance System using Python.
Face recognition systems can be implemented by using facial characteristics as biometrics. Attendance tracking is the most difficult task in any organization. Face recognition is a biometric technique that determines whether the image of a personâ€™s face matches any of the face images stored in a database.

The primary goal was of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance monitoring system for employees working in an organization in order to improve and upgrade the current attendance system to make it more efficient and effective than before. The employee should be in an area containing light so that the detection can be clearly made.

The facial recognition feature embedded in the attendance monitoring system not only ensures accurate attendance but also eliminates flaws. Using a system to overcome defects not only saves resources but also reduces human intervention in the overall process by delegating all complex tasks to the system.

### Prerequisites

1. cmake
2. dlib
3. face_recognition
4. numpy
5. opencv-python
6. Install pybuilder pip install pybuilder
7. Build the project pyb publish
8. Done

## WorkFlows

### 1 Git
I used Git to frequently commit and push my code to GitHub. At the very first beginning I did a pull but as I work alone and I did everything in my IDE my local code base was always up-to-date. My git times can be seen at the [contribution](https://github.com/engineersakibcse47) in GitHub.
